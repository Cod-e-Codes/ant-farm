# Ant Farm

A terminal-based ant colony simulation built in Rust. Watch as ants explore, dig tunnels, collect food, and build pheromone trails in real-time.

## Features

- **Multi-state Ant Behavior**: Ants operate in four distinct states:
  - Wandering: Random exploration and state switching
  - Foraging: Food-seeking behavior with pheromone following
  - Carrying: Returning food to the queen with enhanced pheromone trails
  - Digging: Tunnel creation with directional persistence

- **Pheromone Communication System**: 
  - Home pheromones guide ants back to the colony
  - Distress pheromones signal low health conditions
  - Pheromones decay over time with different rates based on colony health

- **Colony Health Mechanics**:
  - Health decays over time (0.07 per tick)
  - Food collection restores 15 health points
  - Game over when health reaches zero
  - Low health triggers enhanced distress signaling

- **Dynamic World**:
  - Random food spawning throughout the simulation
  - Ant population growth up to 30 ants
  - Real-time tunnel excavation and expansion
  - Occupancy tracking prevents overcrowding

- **Save System**: Automatic save/load functionality to user home directory

## Requirements

- Rust 1.90.0 or later (tested with rustc 1.90.0)
- Terminal with Unicode and color support
- Minimum terminal size: 60x20 characters

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/ant-farm.git
cd ant-farm
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Run the simulation:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Command Line Options
- `--reset`: Start a fresh colony (ignores saved state)

### Controls
- `q`: Quit and save current state
- `r`: Reset to new colony (during gameplay)

### Save File Location
The simulation automatically saves to:
- Unix/Linux: `~/.ant-farm.json`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.ant-farm.json`

## Game Mechanics

### Ant States
- **White dots**: Wandering ants exploring randomly
- **Green dots**: Foraging ants seeking food
- **Yellow dots**: Carrying ants returning food to queen
- **Red dots**: Digging ants creating tunnels

### World Elements
- `â–‘`: Solid ground (can be excavated)
- ` `: Empty tunnels
- `*`: Food sources
- `Q`: Queen ant (colony center)
- `!`: Distress pheromone signals

### Colony Management
- Ants spawn near the queen when population is below 30
- New ants start in digging state to encourage tunnel expansion
- Food collection increases colony health and population capacity
- Pheromone trails guide ant movement and coordination

## Technical Details

- **Tick Rate**: 150ms per simulation step
- **Maximum Population**: 30 ants
- **Pheromone Decay**: 0.92 per tick (home), variable for distress
- **Food Spawn Rate**: 1.5% chance per tick
- **Ant Spawn Rate**: 1.2% chance per tick

## Dependencies

- `crossterm`: Terminal manipulation
- `ratatui`: Terminal user interface
- `rand`: Random number generation
- `serde`: Serialization for save/load
- `serde_json`: JSON serialization format
